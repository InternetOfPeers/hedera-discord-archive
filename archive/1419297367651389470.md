I  am participating in EthGlobal New Delhi 2025, which is going to start in a week where I am thinking about building a federated learning stack over a peer-to-peer network using libp2p, and above that using hedera blockchain as a public ledger for public auditing of training rounds and reward distribution.

It would be great if you could provide a review on the project idea for building in ETh Delhi, and we could discuss more about the details of the implementation.
